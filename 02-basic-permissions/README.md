# This is a list of assignments to help practice linux basics

## Pre-requisites
* linux-practice.sh has been run on the system

NOTE: No commands will be provided in this readme, an answer key will be provided in a seperate file

### Begin Assigments for Permissions
Switch to the linux practice directory

Lets go ahead and list out the file structure and see what we have so far

$> ls -l ~/linux-practice

These lessons will be used to see how changing the permissions can change the behavior of the activity you might try to do but also test if you know what bits do what

#### Assignment #1
Change directory to ***dir1***

Lets change the permission of ***one.txt***. Please set the permission to only the world can ***read*** it

If you try to cat that file, what happens?

Lets change the permission of ***two.txt***. Please set the permission to where only the world can ***execute*** it

If you try to cat that file, what happens?

Lets change the permission of ***three.txt***. Please set the permissions to read and write for both owner and group. Then give no permissions to world

If you try to cat that file, what happens?

#### Assignment #2 
Try to rename the one.txt file

Did it work?


#### Assignment #4
Change back to the linux practice directory

Change the permissions to that directory to execute for all three bits. Then go ahead and try viewing those files or doing anything on them.
